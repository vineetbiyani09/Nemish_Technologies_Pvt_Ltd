*String Manipulation*

Check If a Word Occurs As a Prefix of Any Word in a Sentence
Given a sentence that consists of some words separated by a single space, and a searchWord.
You have to check if searchWord is a prefix of any word in sentence.
Return the index of the word in sentence where searchWord is a prefix of this word (1-indexed).
If searchWord is a prefix of more than one word, return the index of the first word (minimum index). If there is no such word return -1.
A prefix of a string S is any leading contiguous substring of S.

Example 1:
Input: sentence = "i love eating burger", searchWord = "burg"
Output: 4
Explanation: "burg" is prefix of "burger" which is the 4th word in the sentence.
